# HypercubeHopfield

A sparse local-attention variant of the Modern Hopfield network built on a
hypercube graph. Uses softmax-attention retrieval with Hamming-ball connectivity for
a deliberate tradeoff: lower per-update cost than fully-connected Hopfield networks
while retaining capacity that scales super-linearly with dimension.

## What is a Modern Hopfield Network?

Classical Hopfield networks store patterns via Hebbian learning into a weight matrix
and retrieve them by converging from noisy cues. Their capacity is limited to ~0.14N
patterns due to cross-talk interference.

Modern Hopfield networks (Ramsauer et al., 2021) replace the quadratic energy function
with a log-sum-exp (exponential) energy, and store patterns explicitly rather than
collapsing them into weights. Retrieval uses softmax attention -- mathematically
equivalent to the transformer attention mechanism. This achieves exponential
capacity in N, far exceeding the classical limit.

## What is HypercubeHopfield?

HypercubeHopfield implements a Modern Hopfield network where the connectivity is
defined by a hypercube of dimension DIM, giving N = 2^DIM vertices (neurons).
Vertices are addressed by DIM-bit binary strings; each holds a continuous-valued state.

Each vertex connects to all neighbors within a **Hamming ball** of configurable radius.
Neighbor lookup is a single XOR instruction -- no adjacency list is stored. The mask
table is sorted by Hamming distance (closest first) and optionally truncated by a
`neighbor_fraction` parameter (0.0-1.0) for tunable sparsity.

At DIM=8 (N=256) with default reach=DIM/2=4 (162 connections, 63% of vertices), the
network stores 65,000+ patterns with perfect recall in 2 sweeps -- over 250x the
vertex count.

The system is designed for DIM 4-16 (16 to 65536 neurons).

## Quick Start

### Python

```bash
pip install hypercube-hopfield
```

```python
import numpy as np
import hypercube_hopfield as hh

net = hh.HopfieldNetwork(dim=8, seed=42)

# Store random patterns
patterns = np.random.randn(10, net.num_vertices).astype(np.float32)
net.store_patterns(patterns)

# Recall from a noisy cue
cue = patterns[0] + np.random.randn(net.num_vertices).astype(np.float32) * 0.5
result = net.recall(cue)
print(f"Converged: {result.converged}, sweeps: {result.steps}")
```

Pre-built wheels for Python 3.10-3.13 on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
See [docs/Python_SDK.md](docs/Python_SDK.md) for the full API reference.

### C++

```cpp
#include "HopfieldNetwork.h"

auto net = CreateHopfieldNetwork(/*dim=*/8, /*seed=*/42);
net->StorePattern(pattern);                  // span<const float>, size N=256
auto [steps, converged] = net->Recall(cue);  // modifies cue in place
```

Available via CMake FetchContent or find_package.
See [docs/CPP_SDK.md](docs/CPP_SDK.md) for integration guide and full API reference.

## Building from Source

**Requirements:** C++23 compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 17+, MSVC 2022+), CMake 4.1+.

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/HypercubeHopfield
```

No external dependencies beyond the C++ standard library. The build system detects
MinGW, GCC/Clang, and MSVC automatically.
