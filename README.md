# HypercubeHopfield

A sparse local-attention variant of the Modern Hopfield network built on a Boolean
hypercube graph. Uses softmax-attention retrieval with Hamming-ball connectivity for
a deliberate tradeoff: lower per-update cost than fully-connected Hopfield networks
while retaining capacity that scales super-linearly with dimension.

## What is a Modern Hopfield Network?

Classical Hopfield networks store patterns via Hebbian learning into a weight matrix
and retrieve them by converging from noisy cues. Their capacity is limited to ~0.14N
patterns due to cross-talk interference.

Modern Hopfield networks (Ramsauer et al., 2021) replace the quadratic energy function
with a log-sum-exp (exponential) energy, and store patterns explicitly rather than
collapsing them into weights. Retrieval uses softmax attention — mathematically
equivalent to the transformer attention mechanism. This achieves exponential capacity
in N, far exceeding the classical limit.

## What is HypercubeHopfield?

HypercubeHopfield implements a Modern Hopfield network where the connectivity is
defined by a Boolean hypercube of dimension DIM, giving N = 2^DIM vertices (neurons).

Each vertex connects to all neighbors within a **Hamming ball** of configurable radius.
Neighbor lookup is a single XOR instruction — no adjacency list is stored. The mask
table is sorted by Hamming distance (closest first) and optionally truncated by a
`connectivity` parameter (0.0-1.0) for tunable sparsity.

At DIM=8 (N=256) with default reach=DIM/2=4 (162 connections, 63% of vertices), the
network stores 1000+ patterns with perfect recall in 2 sweeps.

The system is designed for DIM 4-16 (16 to 65536 neurons).

## Building and Running

**Requirements:** C++23 compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 16+, MSVC 19.36+), CMake 3.20+.

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/HypercubeHopfield
```

OpenMP is used for parallelism where beneficial. The build system detects MinGW,
GCC/Clang, and MSVC automatically.
