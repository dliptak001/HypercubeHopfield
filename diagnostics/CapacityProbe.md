# CapacityProbe Results

## What is CapacityProbe?

Measures the network's empirical memory capacity: the maximum number of
patterns that can be stored and reliably recalled from 20% noise. Capacity
is defined as the largest pattern count where mean overlap >= 0.90.

Classical Hopfield capacity is ~0.14N. Modern Hopfield networks with
exponential energy functions theoretically achieve exponential capacity
in N. This diagnostic measures the empirical limit on the sparse hypercube
topology with Hamming-ball connectivity.

At high pattern counts, a random sample of 64 patterns is tested per seed
rather than all M (marked with * in the table).

Capacity (overlap >= 90%): 64+ patterns (25.00% of N=256)
(ceiling reached -- increase max_patterns to probe higher)
Result: **PASS**

## Findings

- **Capacity: 64+ patterns (ceiling reached).** The network showed perfect
  recall at all tested counts. The true capacity is higher -- increase
  max_patterns to probe further.
