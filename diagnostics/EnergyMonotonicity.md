# EnergyMonotonicity Results

## What is EnergyMonotonicity?

Verifies that the network energy E(s) is non-increasing across asynchronous
update sweeps during recall. This is a fundamental guarantee of Hopfield
networks: each update step should either decrease energy or leave it unchanged.
An energy increase indicates a bug in the update rule or energy function.

The modern Hopfield energy is:

    E(s) = -(1/N) * sum_v [ beta^-1 * log(sum_mu exp(beta * sim_mu(v))) ]

Result: **PASS**

## Findings

- **Energy is strictly non-increasing across all seeds.** All consecutive
  sweep pairs show delta <= 0 (within float tolerance), confirming the
  update rule and energy function are consistent.
